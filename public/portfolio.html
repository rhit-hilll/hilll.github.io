                <img src="images/portfolio/project1.png" />
                <p>Based on the game <em>Monster Hunter</em> by Capcom, the Seliana Armory is a database crafted in SQL with a C++
                front end that simulates the type to transactions the Armory would be expected to perform. The user is able to both
                query the database for information about the variety of Hunters, companions, weapon and armor, but also add, remove,
                or change the information within the database.</p>

                <img src="images/portfolio/project2.png" />
                <p>Creation of a database in SQL that emulates the roster of each NBA team, along with keeping track of previous
                    game results. Created with a C++ front end that allows users to view, change, or update specific information
                    within the database, and commit those changes permanently to the SQL backend.

                <img src="images/portfolio/project3.png" />
                <p>A C++ terminal based game that allows the player to live in a cabin in the woods. The player is able to go 
                    fishing at the nearby lake for fish, interact with the residents, and sell their catch to upgrade their
                    equipment. Some features include a functioning save system, up to 8 residents to interact with and 12 different
                    varities of fish to catch!

                <img src="images/portfolio/project4.png" />
                <p>A web app that interacts directly with Bungie's Destiny 2 API that allows the user to search for weapon rolls
                    that drop in the game. With mobile functionality, the app is able to search for a certain combination of perks
                    in both the player's inventory, as well as the possibility of that perk set to drop on another weapon. If the
                    specified search terms are found in the player's inventory, allows them to equip that weapon to their character
                    in game in real time (Work in Progress).

        <p>Hi! My name is Liam Hill and I'm currently a Junior Computer Science/Data Science Major attending Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology
            upon this website's creation. This website is a portfolio website, it contains some notable projects that I have created,
            along with an updated resume.</p>
        <p>If I had to describe myself, I'd say that I am a very technical person who wishes to express that side creatively. While I
            enjoy an attention to detail, being allowed the freedom to create things that interest me is one of the primary reason I
            entered into the field. This is reflected in my hobbies, video games being a primary source of entertainment for me, I was
            always curious how a project as large as those got developed using the building blocks we learned at the beginning of our
            Computer Science education. Other hoobies of mine are playing RPGs, drawing, singing, and daydreaming about everything.</p>
        <p>Recently I've pivoted my Computer Science education in to the field of Data Science. As one of the tech industry's fastest
            growing sectors, data is becoming a necessary facet of any business regardless of its size. One of the most important reasons
            I love the field is the opportunity for communication and collaboration between team members. Data on its own is benign, it
            takes context for it to gain relevancy. This relevancy is gained through both the data scientist's interpretations, but also
            the context given by experts that scientist collaborates on projects with. As a person who enjoys this collaboration, the field
            seems like a great fit.</p>
